					<p class="text">Working with his brother Ethan, screenwriter/director Joel Coen has built a reputation as one of the most visionary and idiosyncratic filmmakers of the late 20th century. Combining thoughtful eccentricity, wry humor, arch irony, and often brutal violence, the films of the Coen brothers have become synonymous with a style of filmmaking that pays tribute to classic American movie genres -- especially film noir</p>

					<h3 class="h2 text">Ethan Coen</h3>
					<p class="text">After studying philosophy at Princeton University, Ethan Coen and his brother Joel began writing their first screenplays. The brothers made their screen debut in 1984 with Blood Simple, the first of what would be many films dedicated to a filmmaking style that is notably eccentric, ironic, darkly comic and often violent. The film earned critical acclaim, establishing the brothers' talent.</p>
